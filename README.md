# RTWP-Clustering
Received total Wide band Power (RTWP) is the level of noise withing the frequency band of any cell or you can say the uplink interference. RTWP is related to uplink interference, and has a direct impact on quality of service escpecailly circuit switched calls. It also has importance in the capacity management, as it provides information for the Congestion Control regarding Uplink Interference. There are two main categories of uplink interference, external interference and internal interference. internal interference can be caused by cell loading and loose connection between RRU and antenna. External interference is caused by an external source operating at the same frequency.

# This project
The objectives of this project were: 
1. To determine which cells suffer from internal interference for the field teams to resolve.
2. To determine cells suffering from external interference.
DBSCAN algorithm was used because it proved more versatile to arbitrary distances.
The output of model was evaluated against the categories provided by the engineers and it proved satisfactory.
